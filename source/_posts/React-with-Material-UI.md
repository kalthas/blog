React has been very popular these years. Years back, I had an impulse to migrate a project from some other JS framework to React but couldn't do that due to various reasons. Since then I started taking a look at what's new in React from time to time but I never have had my hands on a real project with React.

Now that I have a bit of free time to do those thing I've always wanted to do, I just want to get myself a thorough understanding about React. And I picked up [FullStack React](https://www.fullstackreact.com/) which turns out to be a very nice book. I'm not an expert in this area, yet.. so I cannot tell whether it covers everything important or not. But IMO this book gets you started very smoothly and it do provides a try-and-understand loop for topics.

One starter app it goes through is timer tracking, with [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/). I know nothing about Semantic UI, but personally I want to get started with Material Design as of now. So I followed every step to build this app, but with [Material UI](https://material-ui-next.com/).

Here's [my implementation](https://github.com/kalthas/react_timer_tracking_app) which leverages components provided by Material UI, but I haven't polish it yet. So basically it functions but the layout looks pretty bad. Since this is just a tryout it's OK for me, and I'd like to focus on bringing Material UI and React together without worrying look&feel much.
